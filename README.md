Phase 1: Planning and Ideation (Miro)
1. Create the Project Board

Set Up the Miro Board: Start by creating a dedicated Miro board for the job-seeking app project. This board will serve as the central hub for brainstorming, user journey mapping, and collaboration.
2. Brainstorming and Ideation

Team Collaboration: Invite all relevant stakeholders (designers, product managers, developers) to the Miro board.
Brainstorm Features: Use sticky notes, mind maps, and diagrams to brainstorm the core features of the app (e.g., job search, application tracking, notifications).
Mood Boards and Inspiration: Gather and organize visual inspiration for the app’s design. This can include color schemes, typography, and design patterns.
3. Define User Personas

User Personas: Create user personas to understand the target audience. This helps in designing an interface that caters to their needs and behaviors.
Persona Details: Include details like demographics, goals, pain points, and job search behavior.
4. Map Out the User Journey

User Flow Diagram: Map out the complete user journey, from launching the app to applying for jobs and tracking applications. This includes different scenarios like job searching, saving jobs, and checking application statuses.
User Touchpoints: Identify key touchpoints and interactions where users will engage with the app.
5. Create Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Wireframe Planning: Before diving into high-fidelity design, sketch out low-fidelity wireframes directly in Miro. Focus on the layout and structure of the main screens (e.g., Home, Job Search, Job Detail, Applications).
Feedback Loop: Share these wireframes with your team to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.
Phase 2: Design Execution (Figma)
1. Set Up the Figma Project

Create a New Figma File: Start a new project in Figma, organizing it into separate pages for different parts of the app (e.g., Home Screen, Job Search, Profile).
Import Assets: If you've collected visual assets or style inspiration in Miro, import them into Figma.
2. Design the UI Components

Navigation Bar: Design the main navigation bar that includes icons and labels for Home, Search, Saved Jobs, Applications, and Profile.
Search Interface: Create a user-friendly search interface with filters for location, job type, salary range, etc.
Job Listings: Design the job listing cards with job title, company name, location, and a brief description. Focus on readability and ease of interaction.
Job Detail Screen: Create a detailed job description page with sections for job responsibilities, requirements, and company information. Include prominent "Apply Now" and "Save Job" buttons.
Profile and Application Tracking: Design the user profile screen, including sections for personal details, resume/CV upload, and settings. Also, design the application tracking screen with visual indicators for application status.
3. Apply Design System

Consistent UI Elements: Use Figma’s components and styles to ensure consistency across the app (e.g., buttons, typography, color schemes).
Responsive Design: Design with different screen sizes in mind, ensuring the app is responsive and user-friendly on both mobile and tablet devices.
4. Prototyping

Interactive Prototypes: Use Figma’s prototyping feature to create interactive prototypes of the app. This allows you to simulate user interactions and test the flow between screens.
User Testing: Share the prototype with a small group of users or stakeholders to gather feedback on usability and design.
5. Iteration and Finalization

Feedback Integration: Based on user testing and team feedback, make necessary design tweaks in Figma.
Finalize Designs: Once satisfied with the design, finalize all screens and prepare them for handoff to developers.
6. Handoff to Development

Design Handoff: Use Figma’s developer handoff features (like Inspect mode) to provide developers with the necessary design specs, assets, and code snippets.
Collaboration Between Figma and Miro
Linking Designs: Embed Figma designs into Miro to provide context during user journey discussions or when gathering feedback from stakeholders.
Continuous Updates: Keep both the Miro board and Figma file updated as the project evolves, ensuring that everyone is on the same page.
